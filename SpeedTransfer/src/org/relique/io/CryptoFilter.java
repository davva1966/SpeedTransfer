 * minimalistic approach to decrypting a file.

 * a class implementing this interface is required to return one character at a
 * time from the given InputStream. the InputStream is encrypted, the client
 * receives it clear-text.
 * 
 * the encryption used may require you to read more than one character from the
 * InputStream, but this is your business, as is all initialization required by
 * your cipher, the client will be offered one deciphered character at a time.
